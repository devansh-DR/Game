# Turtle Crossing the Road

This is a simple Python program that simulates a turtle crossing the road. The turtle starts at one side of the road and tries to reach the other side. Cars drive along the road, and the turtle must avoid being hit. If the turtle is hit, the game ends. If the turtle reaches the other side, the level is won and another level starts with high speed cars. 

How to Play

To play the game, simply run the following command in your terminal:

python main.py

The game will then start and you will see a turtle on the left side of the road. Cars will start driving along the road, and you must use the arrow keys to move the turtle. If the turtle is hit by a car, the game ends. If the turtle reaches the right side of the road, the game is won.

Controls

Up arrow: Move the turtle up
Down arrow: Move the turtle down
